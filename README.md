## Overview

**Project Title**:Hangman Game

**Project Description**: A simple text-based Hangman game where users guess letters to uncover a hidden word. 
Players have a limited number of attempts and receive feedback after each guess. 
The program tracks correct guesses and displays the progress of the word as underscores and revealed letters.

**Project Goals**: Practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.
Learn to debug and build functional software.
Create a user-friendly text-based game that can be expanded with additional features.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and set up your environment.
2. Download or clone the project repository from GitHub.
3. Compile and run the Hangman.java file to start the game.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Start the game and follow the on-screen instructions.
2. Guess one letter at a time when prompted.
3. Continue until the word is guessed or attempts run out.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:
